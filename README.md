# Features

- **Random & Predefined Mazes**  
  Load built-in puzzles or any text-based maze file from `mazes.txt`.  
- **BFS Solver**  
  Watch the computer compute the optimal path; then try to match it.  
- **Move Counter**  
  You get exactly as many moves as the BFS solution; track them in real time.  
- **Win/Lose Pop-Ups**  
  Instant feedback when you reach the exitâ€”or run out of moves.  
- **Colorful SDL2 Graphics**  
  Walls, paths, start/end, and player are all color-coded.  
- **Cross-Platform Builds**  
  One-step `make run` on Linux/macOS or a simple batch script on Windows.
